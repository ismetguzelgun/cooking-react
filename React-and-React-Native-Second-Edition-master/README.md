## Running the examples

Once you've cloned this repository, you can run each example throughout the
chapters as a standalone application. First, open a terminal and change into
the directory of the example that you want to run. For example:

```
cd Chapter02/builtin-html-tags
```

Then, you can install the dependencies for the example:

```
npm install
```

Finally, you can run the example:

```
npm start
```

This should open a web browser tab for you with the running app inside. In the
case of React Native examples, the process is similar. See chapter 13 for
steps on getting started with Expo and installing native IDEs.
