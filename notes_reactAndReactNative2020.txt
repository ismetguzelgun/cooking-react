#DIV vs. Fragment

If your React component renders several sibling elements, say three <p> elements, for
instance, you would have to wrap them in <div> because React would only allow
components to return a single element. The only problem with this approach is that it leads
to a lot of unnecessary DOM structure. Wrapping your elements with <Fragment> is the
same as wrapping them with <div>, except there won't be any superfluous DOM elements.
You can read more about fragments here: https:/ / reactjs. org/ docs/ fragments. html.

#Why Div?

You may have noticed the surrounding <div> tag, grouping together all
of the other tags as its children. This is because React needs a root
component to render.

#State vs Props.

The real difference is that with
properties, it's often a parent component that decides when to render the JSX. The
component doesn't actually know how to re-render itself. As you'll see throughout this
book, this type of top-down flow is easier to predict than state that changes all over the
place.
